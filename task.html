    <h1>Delhi Struggles with Rising Pollution Levels</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published on: September 22, 2025 | Location: New Delhi</p>

    <p>New Delhi continues to battle alarming levels of air pollution as the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossed the “severe” mark this week. Thick smog has reduced visibility across the city, raising health concerns among residents.</p>
    
    <p>Experts attribute the rising pollution to vehicular emissions, stubble burning in nearby states, and industrial activities. The situation is worsened during early winter months when weather conditions trap pollutants in the air.</p>
    
    <p>Schools and colleges have been advised to reduce outdoor activities, while the government is considering restrictions on construction work and traffic to control the situation.</p>
    
    <p>Doctors have urged citizens to wear masks, avoid outdoor exercise, and use air purifiers indoors to minimize health risks. Children and elderly people are considered most vulnerable during this period.</p>

    <p>Despite several measures over the years, pollution remains a major challenge for Delhi, highlighting the urgent need for long-term solutions and stricter enforcement of environmental laws.</p>
